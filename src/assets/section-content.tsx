          My name is Veronica Russell, a primary school teacher with 9 years'
          experience working with children of differing abilities in inner
          London schools.
          <br />
          Specializing in Maths and English (Reading and Writing), I have a
          wealth of experience teaching children from age 6 to 9 (Year2 – Year
          4).
          <br />
          Currently assigned to four primary schools as a registered tutor
          through the NTP – National Tutoring Programme, I deliver bespoke
          programmes to provide intensive support for children that need to
          catch up on their missed learning. The NTP is a government funded
          programme so, to ensure that I was suitable for this role, a vigorous
          training and vetting process was undertaken. I also currently hold an
          enhanced DBS check.

          PSHE (Personal, Social, Health and Economic education) Co-ordinator –
          The profile of PSHE was elevated for all pupils through my creation of
          a PSHE curriculum. The intention was to allow pupils to gain the
          required knowledge, skills and understanding to be able to lead
          confident, healthy and independent lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          RRSA (Rights Respecting School Awards) Lead – I initiated the process
          of allowing the school to become a ’Rights Respecting School’ and
          encouraged the school community to place the UN Convention on the
          Rights of the Child at the heart of the school’s ethos and curriculum.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reading Co-ordinator –As a result of implementing new initiatives, I
          was able to raise the profile of reading in the school. Monthly ‘early
          morning reading sessions’ for parents/ carers were organised as well
          as visits to the local library and Book Fairs.
        </p>
        <p>
          School-Based/ NQT (New Qualified Teacher) Mentor – My role was to
          promote the growth and development of the student teachers that I
          mentored. Through modelling and frequent conversations, I was able to
          pass on invaluable knowledge helping the students to not only develop
          their educational voice but to consolidate their own effective and
          efficient teaching style.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my teaching career I have also had direct responsibility of
          overseeing year groups. I have acquired the status of being Head of
          KS1, Lower Key Stage 2 and Year 2. This entailed ensuring that the
          teachers and teaching assistants of a number of different classes,
          worked as a cohesive team to create an environment where all the needs
          of our pupils were met, and they were in a position to excel.

              Since my daughter has been having these online weekly sessions her
              self-esteem has grown, she is much more motivated and I have seen
              a willingness to learn. These lessons have given her an extra
              sense of responsibility because she wants to do well.

              She is dedicated and keeps the notes that she makes during the
              lesson so that she can revise. I can also see an improvement in
              her confidence.

              these lessons I did not know anything about commutative law now I
              know so much about it.
